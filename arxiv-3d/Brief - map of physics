An interactive 2D visualization of academic papers arranged in a temporal and disciplinary layout

Core Layout

The visualization is a 2D chart rendered on a large canvas or SVG.
-X-axis: publication year (time progression left → right).
-Y-axis: AI primary field or discipline (grouped by topic).
-The scene should be pannable and zoomable horizontally and vertically with smooth transitions and inertial motion.
-no gridlines

Hidden Z-Axis (Depth by Citations)
-Each node has a hidden z-position derived from its citation count:
-Higher citations → closer to the viewer (appears larger, brighter, more focused).
-Lower citations → further back (smaller, slightly faded).
-As the user zooms in, nodes with higher z-values appear to advance forward, while lower-z nodes subtly drift apart in depth, creating a pseudo-3D parallax effect.
-The movement should feel organic — like “flying through space” — but still remain visually 2D.

Nodes
-Each paper is represented as a rectangle with curved corners:
-Position: (x = year, y = field lane ± jitter).
-Size: base radius, slightly scaled by citation count.
-Color: based on AI primary field (consistent palette).
-Opacity: modulated by z-depth for atmospheric perspective.
-Each node displays its title in small, legible text inside the node with text wrapping and leaving a lot of blank space in the node
-the text should be centered in the top of the node and contained within the node. 

When zooming:
-Nodes grow slightly and separate around the zoom focus point. 
-There should be separation of the nodes as you zoom in so the closer nodes move further away and avoid overlapping. I also think the separation needs to be a touch quicker than the scroll and hopefully it will create a curving effect as nodes fly past the screen
-The zoom steps become finer at close range for smooth exploration.

Edges
-Edges connect nodes that have citation relationships.
By default:
-Visible, thin, and neutral grey (#aaa) with no arrowheads.
-Light transparency to avoid clutter.

When a node is selected:
-Its connected edges are highlighted and gain arrowheads showing direction.
-All other edges fade to a muted grey.
-Connected nodes remain colored; unconnected nodes fade to low opacity.

Interactions

Hover:
-Highlights the hovered node’s connected edges and nodes.
-Displays a floating tooltip beside the node with:
-Title
-Author(s)
-Year
-Field
-Citation count
-Link to source (clickable)

Click (Select):
-Locks the node as “selected.”
-Highlights only its citation network (incoming + outgoing).
-Displays a persistent detail panel or tooltip with full paper info.
-Clicking empty space or pressing Esc clears the selection.

Pan & Zoom:
-Smooth, continuous movement.
-Scrolling in increases node size and separation; scrolling out compresses the map.
-Zoom centered around the mouse pointer for intuitive navigation.
-All transitions (node position, scale, opacity) should be eased for fluidity.
-Axes & Styling
-X-axis: publication years (integer ticks).
-Y-axis: AI fields (labels on left).
-Gridlines: no gridlines
-Background: soft neutral tone (#f0f0f0 or similar).
-Font: clean sans-serif (e.g., “Plus Jakarta Sans” or “Poppins”).
-Consistent color palette (e.g., Tableau 10 or custom field colors).
-Tooltips and side cards styled as lightweight floating panels with soft shadows.

Overall Feel

The visualization should feel immersive, smooth, and data-driven, blending scientific clarity with spatial depth.
It should invite exploration — users glide through the citation landscape, discovering how ideas connect across time and fields.
