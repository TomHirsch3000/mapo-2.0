Task list

 - change the backend code 
  - import all papers on physics 
  		Task	Feasible on Local?	Notes
		Just storing paper IDs (~12 bytes each)	✅ Yes	10 million IDs ≈ ~120 MB
		Storing full metadata (title, abstract, citations, etc.)	⚠️ Maybe	Easily 5–20 GB+ depending on fields stored
		Analyzing in memory (e.g., pandas)	⚠️ Maybe	You'll need 16GB+ RAM ideally
		Visualizing all papers in 3D	❌ Not really	You’ll need to filter or cluster
		Searching/subsetting	✅ Yes	If you store in an indexed format like SQLite, DuckDB, or Elasticsearch

- generate images for each paper 

- make links clickable 
- make papers searchable 
- filter the papers being shown 



📝 Restart Environment: Semantic Scholar + 3D Papers Viewer

1. Activate Python Environment

    cd path/to/your/project
    source venv/bin/activate         # for Unix/macOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate          # for Windows

2. Start Local LLM (Ollama)

    ollama run mistral

   Or keep Ollama running in background:

    ollama serve &

3. Run Backend Script

    python summarize_semantic_scholar.py

   Generates nodes.json and edges.json and copies them to the frontend.

4. Start Frontend (React 3D Viewer)

    cd ../arxiv-3d-frontend
    npm install         # only needed once
    npm run dev         # or: npm start

5. Open in Browser

    http://localhost:3000

6. (Optional) Rebuild or Debug

    - Check for errors in summarize_semantic_scholar.py output.
    - Ensure nodes.json and edges.json are present in arxiv-3d-frontend/public/
