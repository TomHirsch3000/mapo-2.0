# Brief - Map of Physics

## Overview
An interactive 2D visualization of academic papers arranged in a graph form. The visualization feels immersive, smooth, and data-driven, blending scientific clarity with spatial depth to invite exploration of the citation landscape.

## Core Interface
*   **Canvas**: A 2D chart rendered on a large white background (~#f0f0f0).
*   **Navigation**: Pannable and zoomable (horizontally and vertically) with smooth transitions and inertial motion. Zoom is centered around the mouse pointer.
*   **Grid**: No gridlines.
*   **Bottom Panel**: Always visible, taking up 20% of the screen height. Displays summary details of selected nodes (galaxy or paper).

## Layout Modes
The application features a toggleable layout system that re-organizes nodes in real-time between Central and Timeline layouts.

### 1. Central Layout (Cluster)
*   **Use Case**: Seeing the "center of gravity" of a field.
*   **Physics**:
    *   Nodes gravitate toward the center (Radial force).
    *   Higher impact nodes (more citations) are pulled closer to the center.
    *   Collision detection prevents overlapping.

### 2. Timeline Layout (Chronological)
*   **Use Case**: Understanding the history and evolution of a field.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **X-Axis**: Represents Time (Year of publication). Oldest on the left, newest on the right.
    *   **Vertical Distribution**: Nodes spread out away from the timeline axis to avoid overlap. Larger nodes are positioned closer to the axis, while smaller nodes are pushed further away.
    *   **Axis**: Displays decade markers at the bottom.

## Views (Levels of Detail)

### 1. Galaxy View (Macro Level)
*   **Concept**: Nodes represent groups of papers.
*   **Grouping**: Selectable via a dropdown (Field, Author, or Institution). Default is **Field**.
*   **Nodes**:
    *   Shape: Circle.
    *   Size: Based on the number of papers in the galaxy group.
    *   Color: Varies based on the active grouping (e.g., Field), with distinct colors for each group.
    *   Positioning: Defaults to Central layout unless toggled.
*   **Edges**:
    *   **Structure**: Bi-directional connections (separate edges for citations vs. references).
    *   **Color**: Colored according to the source node.
    *   **Style**: Prominent and clearly visible (not too thin). Curved and directional with tapering width and fading tail (no arrowhead).
    *   **Thickness**: Determined by the volume of connections.

### 2. Topic View (Micro Level)
*   **Concept**: Represents individual papers within a selected group (e.g., "All papers in Quantum Physics").
*   **Nodes**:
    *   Shape: Rectangular cards with curved corners.
    *   Content: Paper title (centered at top, wrapped, legible).
    *   Size: Base radius scaled slightly by citation count.
    *   Color: Always based on the AI Primary Field (consistent palette), regardless of Galaxy View aggregation.
    *   Opacity: Modulated by z-depth for atmospheric perspective.
*   **Edges**:
    *   Connect papers via citations and references.
    *   **Style**: Prominent and clearly visible. Curved and directional with tapering width and fading tail (no arrowhead).
*   **Interaction**:
    *   **Highlight Mode (Hover/Select)**:
        *   **Active Elements**: The selected node and its direct connections (neighbors) remain fully opaque and colored.
        *   **Edges**: Connecting edges are highlighted and color-coded (Orange for Citations, Blue for References).
        *   **Background**: All unrelated nodes and edges fade to grey/low opacity to focus attention on the active subgraph.
*   **Bottom Panel**: Displays abstract and full details of the selected paper.

## Transitions & Navigation

### View Transitions (Galaxy ↔ Topic)
*   **To Topic View**:
    *   Clicking a galaxy node.
    *   Scrolling (zooming) into a galaxy node.
    *   *Effect*: Galaxy view disappears; only nodes from that topic appear.
*   **To Galaxy View**:
    *   Scrolling out far enough from Topic view.
    *   Clicking the 'Back' button in Topic view.

### Layout Transitions
*   **Movement**: When toggling between Timeline and Central views, nodes should visibly move *even more slowly* to their new locations (approx. 0.5 seconds).

### Zoom Behavior
*   **Separation**: As you zoom in, nodes grow slightly and separate to avoid overlap.
*   **Precision**: Zoom steps become finer at close range for smooth exploration.

## Visual Behavior & Physics

### Node Positioning Requirements
*   **Loading**: Nodes must fade in *already in position*. No chaotic movement on load.
*   **Determinism**: Node positions must be deterministic and remembered during the session. Returning to a view shows nodes in the exact same place.

### Z-Axis & Parallax (Depth by Citations)
*   **Concept**: A hidden z-position derived from citation count.
    *   **High Citations**: Closer to viewer (larger, brighter, focused).
    *   **Low Citations**: Further back (smaller, slightly faded).
*   **Parallax**: Zooming in makes high-z nodes appear to advance and separate faster than low-z nodes, creating a pseudo-3D "flying through space" effect while keeping the interface 2D.

## Aesthetics
*   **Font**: Clean sans-serif (e.g., "Plus Jakarta Sans" or "Poppins").
*   **Palette**: Consistent color palette (e.g., Tableau 10 or custom field colors).
*   **UI Components**: Tooltips and side cards styled as lightweight floating panels with soft shadows.
